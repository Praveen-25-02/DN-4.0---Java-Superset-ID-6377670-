Task-1: (Exercise : 2)

E-commerce Product Search – Java
This is a simple Java project that shows how search works in an e-commerce app — like when you're looking for a product by name.

We used two types of search:

Linear Search – goes through each product one by one.

Binary Search – quickly narrows it down by dividing the list in half (but only works on sorted data).
